// function scope : INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT
// Functional programming is about:
    // Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change
    // Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output
    // Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

//Higher order function : The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value
    //When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a "lambda".

//semantic error : means whatever we write in code not follow our thought for that
//sneaky error : means when we use some feature and it gives unexpected output
